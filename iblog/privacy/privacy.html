        The Company reserves the right to reject non-conforming requests or requests from prohibited states.

        We offer several contests and other features on the Website. You can participate for the chance to win prizes.
        Our contests are free to play. Our features may change from time to time, at our sole discretion. We reserve the
        right to modify or cancel contests at any time without notice to You. Contest rules and scoring may differ from
        contest to contest. Each of our contests are governed by specific rules, as may be modified from time to time,
        which are set forth in the official rules for each contest and are incorporated into these Terms by this
        reference.
<br>
        You have the responsibility to review the rules prior to participating in any contest, and to review the rules
        for any changes. You agree to abide by the then-current rules for the contest(s) in which You participate. Your
        failure to follow the then-current rules for the contest(s) in which You participate will result in Your
        immediate and automatic forfeiture of the contest(s), and We reserve the right to immediately suspend or
        terminate Your access to Clash.gg.
<br>
        Winners are determined by the applicable documentation associated with the contest. Clash.gg may not be used for
        any form of illicit gambling.
<br>
        We also offer “Case Battles,” which involve between two and six players. All players purchase a loot box and
        open the boxes simultaneously. The player with the better item keeps that item and the other players’ prizes.
<br>
        Upgrader is another game mode. A player selects an item they would like to “upgrade” to – which include any of
        the virtual items we offer. Players select the odds of winning the prize (which determines the cost). If a
        player wins, he or she can either choose to be credited for the value of the item or have the item sent directly
        to his or her Steam account.
<br>
        Rain – We offer a rewards program called “rain.” A base of 25 credits plus a percentage of all spend on the site
        during the stated time period (30 minutes) is added to each rain. Each rain lasts for 30 minutes. At the end of
        this 30-minute period, any user who is over level 10 or has completed the KYC on site can join and receive equal
        share of the total pot. Rain is a reward for players to collect while they are actively playing on the site as
        part of our free to play system. Abusing Rain, contrary to its intended purpose, may result in the termination
        of your account at the sole discretion of the Clash.gg team.
<br>
        Please note that, in New York and Florida, the maximum redemption value for a prize won on any one spin or play
        is $5,000 and any prize with a value in excess of $5,000 will be reduced to a maximum value of $5,000.</p>
